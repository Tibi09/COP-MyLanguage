# COP-MyLanguage
Language made with MPS


Constraints:
- in a function that has void as the return type, in order to return nothing ( return ; ) you'll have to type 'empty' after the return keyword
- you can start using the parameters of a function from the second line of its body
- declarations in for loop definition are not supported. Please declare the iterator variable outside the loop
- when adding actual parameters after calling a function with the keyword 'call', first add a number in the parantheses and then replace it or add more parameters by pressing Enter

Problems:
- functions cannot return parameters or variables declared inside them
