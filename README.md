# COP-MyLanguage
Language made with MPS


Constraints:
- in a function that has void as the return type, in order to return nothing ( return ; ) you'll have to type 'empty' after the return keyword
- you can start using the parameters of a function from the second line of its body
- declarations in for loop definition are not supported. Please declare the iterator variable outside the loop

Problems:
- scoping of else part of if
- functions cannot return parameters
- pure and non-pure functions (currently only non-pure functions available)
